### ðŸŒŸ Projects

Here are some of the notable projects I've worked on:

### 1. Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

- In my final year project, Developed a deep learning model aimed at detecting diabetic retinopathy a common eye disease that can lead to vision loss in people with diabetes.
- I used the EfficientNet-b3 and InceptionV3 models to compare their performance in detecting the disease.
- EfficientNet-b3 is a convolutional neural network architecture that has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of image classification tasks.
- InceptionV3 is another popular convolutional neural network architecture that has also been widely used for image classification.
- By comparing the performance of these two models on the task of diabetic retinopathy detection, I was able to gain valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
- This project allowed me to apply my knowledge of deep learning and computer vision to a real-world problem with significant impact.

### 2. Cityscapes Project

- Performed semantic segmentation of urban street scenes using the U-Net convolutional neural network architecture
- U-Net is known for its proven effectiveness in biomedical image segmentation and its unique architecture designed for capturing contextual information and precise localization.
- The purpose of this project extends beyond academic exploration; it holds potential applications in urban planning, autonomous driving systems, and traffic management.
